                <div class="card-description">A Dance with Dragons is the fifth of seven planned novels in the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire by American author George R. R. Martin.A Dance of Dragons was originally the title of the second novel in the sequence, when Martin still envisaged the series as a trilogy."The Dance of the Dragons" is the name given to a civil war in the prior history of Westeros, leading to much speculation that the novel would feature the long-awaited invasion of Westeros by the army of Daenerys Targaryen. However, at ComicCon 2006, Martin said that is not necessarily what the title is referring to</div>
